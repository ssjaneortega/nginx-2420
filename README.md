# nginx-2420

### Tutorial for serving a web page of your choice on Arch Linux
Before proceeding with installing anything, lets make sure our system is up-to-date with:
`sudo pacman -Syu`

In order to live serve web pages, you will need to install the following:
- Vim  `sudo Pacman -S vim` : this will be our text/file editor

- Nginx  `sudo Pacman -S nginx` : this will be our web server software used to liveserve webpages

Go ahead and make the following directory: web/html/nginx-2420 with  `mkdir web/html/nginx-2420`
This is where the demo.html will be located.

Change into the directory just created by: `cd web/html/nginx-2420` 
Copy and paste the demo.html after running `vim demo.html`
